<h2>One Toss of the Dice </h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never not even when cast in eternal circumstances from the depths of a shipwreck whether the abyss whitened becalmed furious under an inclination under an inclination glides desperately with wing its own in advance refallen with a difficulty in setting up flight and covering the outpourings cutting utterly the leaps very interiorly resumes the shade buried in the deep by that alternative sail as to adapt to its wingspan its gaping depth as the hull of a vessel tilted to one or the other side the master outside old calculations where the maneuver with age forgotten arisen inferringlong ago he grasped the helm of that conflagration at his feet of the unanimous horizon there is preparing stirring and mixing in the fist that might clutch it as one menaces a destiny and the winds the unique number which cannot be another spirit to hurl it cannot be another spirit to hurl it in the tempest refolding the division and passing proud hesitates a corpse. 
    <h2>By The Arm Set Apart</h2>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the secret it keeps rather than to play like a hoary maniac the game in the name of waves one invades the chief flows like a submissive beard shipwreck that direct from man sans ship no matter where vain ancestrally to not open the hand clenched beyond the useless head legacy in the disappearance to someone ambiguous the last immemorial demon having from null regions induced the old man towards this supreme conjunction with probability he his puerile shade caressed and polished and rendered and laved made supple by the wave and abstracted from the hard bones lost between the planks born of a gambol the sea with the grandfather tempting or the grandfather against the sea an idle chance betrothal whose veil of illusion gushed their phobia like the phantom of a gesture will totter will fall.
    <h2>Madness Will Abolish </h2>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if an insinuation simple in silence rolled with irony or the mystery precipitated howled in some nearby whirlpool of hilarity or horror flutters around the gulf without strewing it nor fleeing and cradles the virgin index as if plume solitary distraught save that encounters or skims it a midnight cap and immobilizes in velvet crumpled by a guffaw somber that rigid whiteness derisory in opposition to the sky too much for not marking exiguously whosoever bitter prince of the reef puts it on like the heroic irresistible but contained by his little reason virile in lightning concerned expiatory and pubescent mute laughter that if the lucid and seigniorial aigrette of vertigo with invisible brow scintillates then shadows a stature dainty tenebrous erect in its siren torsion time to slap with impatient scales ultimate bifurcated a rock false manor right away evaporated in mists that imposed a limit on infinity it was stellar issue number existed he otherwise than scattered hallucination of agony commenced he and ceased he upwelling but denied and closed when apparent at last by some profusion widespread in rarity ciphered he evidence of the sum if only one illuminated he it would be worse no more nor less indifferently but as much chance falls the plume.  
    <h2>Rhythmic Suspense of the Sinister</h2>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bury itself in original foams not long ago whence sprang up its delirium to a peak withered by the identical neutrality of the gulf nothing of the memorable crisis when might the event have been accomplished in view of every result null human will have taken place an ordinary elevation pours absence but the place inferior lapping whatsoever as if to disperse the act void abruptly which if not by its falsehood might have founded perdition in those regions of the wave in which all reality dissolves except at the altitude perhaps as far as a place fuses with beyond apart from the interest as to it signaled in general according to such obliquity by such declivity of fires toward this must be the septentrion also north a constellation cold from forgetting and desuetude not so much that it does not enumerate on some surface vacant and superior the successive clash sidereally of a total count in formation watching doubting rolling shining and meditating before stopping at some last point that consecrates it every thought sends forth one toss of the dice.
