        <p> Distraught feather save that encounters or skims it a midnight cap and immobilizes in velvet crumpled by a guffaw somber that rigid whiteness derisory in opposition to the sky too much for not marking exiguously whosoever bitter prince of the reef puts it on like the heroic irresistible but contained by his little reason virile in lightning concerned expiatory and pubescent mute laughter that if the lucid and seigniorial aigrette of vertigo with invisible brow scintillates then shadows a stature dainty tenebrous erect in its siren torsion time to slap with impatient scales ultimate bifurcated a rock false manor right away evaporated in mists that imposed a limit on infinity it was stellar issue number existed he otherwise than scattered hallucination of agony commenced he and ceased me upwelling but denied and closed when apparent at last by some profusion widespread in rarity ciphered he evidence of the sum if only one illuminated he it would be worse no more nor less indifferently but as much chance falls the plume rhythmic suspense of the sinister to bury itself in original foams not long ago whence sprang up its delirium to a peak withered by the identical.
