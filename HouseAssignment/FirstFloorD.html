 <p>KROGSTAD. May I ask if the lady was a Mrs Linden?</p> <br>
 <p>NORA. Yes.</p><br>
 <p>KROGSTAD. Who has just come to town?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Yes. To-day.</p><br>
 <p>KROGSTAD. I believe she is an intimate friend of yours.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Certainly. But I don't understand</p><br>
<p>KROGSTAD. I used to know her too.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. I know you did.</p><br>
 <p>KROGSTAD. Ah! You know all about it. I thought as much. Now,
 frankly, is Mrs. Linden to have a place in the Bank?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. How dare you catechise me in this way, Mr. Krogstad- you, a
 subordinate of my husband's? But since you ask, you shall know.
 Yes, Mrs. Linden is to be employed. And it is I who recommended
 her, Mr. Krogstad. Now you know</p><br>
<p> KROGSTAD. Then my guess was right.</p><br>
<p> NORA. [Walking up and down.] You see one has a wee bit of
 influence, after all. It doesn't follow because one's only a
 woman- When people are in a subordinate position, Mr. Krogstad,
 they ought really to be careful how they offend anybody who- h'm</p><br>
<p>KROGSTAD. -who has influence?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Exactly.</p><br>
 <p>KROGSTAD. [Taking another tone.] Mrs. Helmer, will you have the
 kindness to employ your influence on my behalf?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. What? How do you mean?</p><br>
 <p>KROGSTAD. Will you be so good as to see that I retain my subordinate position in the Bank?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. What do you mean? Who wants to take it from you?</p><br>
 <p>KROGSTAD. Oh, you needn't pretend ignorance. I can very well
 understand that it cannot be pleasant for your friend to meet
 me; and I can also understand now for whose sake I am to be
 hounded out.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. But I assure you</p><br>
<p>KROGSTAD. Come come now, once for all: there is time yet, and I advise you to use your influence to prevent it.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence- absolutely none.</p><br>
<p> KROGSTAD. None? I thought you said a moment ago</p><br>
<p>NORA. Of course not in that sense. I! How can you imagine that I
 should have any such influence over my husband?</p><br>
