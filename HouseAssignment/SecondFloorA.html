            <p>ANNA. I've found the box with the fancy dress at last.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Thanks; put it down on the table.</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. [Does so.] But I'm afraid it's very much out of order.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Oh, I wish I could tear it into a hundred thousand pieces!</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. Oh, no. It can easily be put to rights- just a little
 patience.</p><br>
 <p> NORA. I shall go and get Mrs. Linden to help me.</p><br>
 <p> ANNA. Going out again? In such weather as this! You'll catch cold,
 ma'am, and be ill.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Worse things might happen.- What are the children doing?</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. They're playing with their Christmas presents, poor little
 dears; but</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Do they often ask for me?</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. You see they've been so used to having their mamma with them.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Yes; but, Anna, I can't have them so much with me in future.</p><br>
 <p> ANNA. Well, little children get used to anything.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Do you think they do? Do you believe they would forget their
 mother if she went quite away?</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. Gracious me! Quite away?</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Tell me, Anna- I've so often wondered about it- how could you
 bring yourself to give your child up to strangers?</p><br>
 <p> ANNA. I had to when I came to nurse my little Miss Nora.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. But how could you make up your mind to it?</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. When I had the chance of such a good place? A poor girl who's
 been in trouble must take what comes. That wicked man did nothing
 for me.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. But your daughter must have forgotten you.</p><br>
  <p>ANNA. Oh, no, ma'am, that she hasn't. She wrote to me both when she
 was confirmed and when she was married.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. [Embracing her.] Dear old Anna- you were a good mother to me
 when I was little.</p><br>
