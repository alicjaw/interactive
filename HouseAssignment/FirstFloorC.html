             MRS. LINDEN. [Going to her.] My dear Nora, don't you be vexed with
 me. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so
 bitter. You have no one to work for, yet you have to be always on
 the strain. You must live; and so you become selfish. When I
 heard of the happy change in your fortunes- can you believe it?-
                I was glad for my own sake more than for yours.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. How do you mean? Ah, I see! You think Torvald can perhaps do
 something for you.</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. Yes; I thought so.</p><br>
<p> NORA. And so he shall, Christina. Just you leave it all to me. I
 shall lead up to it beautifully!- I shall think of some
 delightful plan to put him in a good humour! Oh, I should so love
 to help you.</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. How good of you, Nora, to stand by me so warmly!
 Doubly good in you, who knows so little of the troubles and
 burdens of life.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. I? I know so little of-?</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. [Smiling.] Oh, well- a little fancy-work, and so
 forth.- You're a child, Nora.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Tosses her head and paces the room.] Oh, come, you mustn't
 be so patronising!</p>
