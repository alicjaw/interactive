            <p> RANK. [Bending towards her.] Nora- do you think he is the only one
 who-?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [With a slight start.] Who-?</p><br>
 <p>RANK. Who would gladly give his life for you?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Sadly.] Oh!</p><br>
 <p>RANK. I have sworn that you shall know it before I- go. I shall
 never find a better opportunity.- Yes, Nora, now I have told you;
 and now you know that you can trust me as you can no one else.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Standing up; simply and calmly.] Let me pass, please.</p><br>
 <p>RANK. [Makes way for her, but remains sitting.] Nora</p><br>
<p>NORA. [In the doorway.] Ellen, bring the lamp. [Crosses to the
 stove.] Oh dear, Doctor Rank, that was too bad of you.</p><br>
<p> RANK. [Rising.] That I have loved you as deeply as- any one else?
 Was that too bad of me?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. No, but that you should have told me so. It was so
 unnecessary</p><br>
<p>RANK. What do you mean? Did you know-?</p>
