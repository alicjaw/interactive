                <p> HELMER. [In his room.] Is that my lark twittering there?</p><br>
                <p> NORA. [Busy opening some of her parcels.] Yes, it is.</p><br>
                <p>HELMER. Is it the squirrel frisking around?</p><br>
                <p>NORA. Yes!</p><br>
                <p>HELMER When did the squirrel get home?</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Just this minute. [Hides the bag of macaroons in her pocket and wipes her mouth.] Come here, Torvald, and see what I've been buying.</p><br>

 <p>HELMER. Don't interrupt me. [A little later he opens the door and
 looks in, pen in hand.] Buying, did you say? What! All that? Has
     my little spendthrift been making the money fly again?</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Why, Torvald, surely we can afford to launch out a little
      now. It's the first Christmas we haven't had to pinch.</p><br>
  <p>HELMER. Come come; we can't afford to squander money.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Oh yes, Torvald, do let us squander a little, now- just the
 least little bit! You know you'll soon be earning heaps of money.</p><br>
  <p>HELMER. Yes, from New Year's Day. But there's a whole quarter
 before my first salary is due.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. Never mind; we can borrow in the meantime.</p><br>
  <p>HELMER. Nora! [He goes up to her and takes her playfully by the
 ear.] Still my little featherbrain! Supposing I borrowed a
 thousand crowns to-day, and you made ducks and drakes of them
 during Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve a tile blew off
 the roof and knocked my brains out</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Laying her hand on his mouth.] Hush! How can you talk so
 horridly?</p><br>
  <p>HELMER. But supposing it were to happen- what then?</p><br>
  <p>NORA. If anything so dreadful happened, it would be all the same to
 me whether I was in debt or not.</p><br>
  <p>HELMER. But what about the creditors?</p><br>
 <p> NORA. They! Who cares for them? They're only strangers.</p><br>
 <p> HELMER. Nora, Nora! What a woman you are! But seriously, Nora, you
 know my principles on these points. No debts! No borrowing! Home
 life ceases to be free and beautiful as soon as it is founded on
 borrowing and debt. We two have held out bravely till now, and we
 are not going to give in at the last.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. [Going to the fireplace.] Very well- as you please, Torvald.</p><br>
 <p> HELMER. [Following her.] Come come; my little lark mustn't droop
 her wings like that. What? Is my squirrel in the sulks? [Takes
 out his purse.] Nora, what do you think I have here?</p><br>
  <p>NORA. [Turning round quickly.] Money!</p><br>
  <p>HELMER. There! [Gives her some notes.] Of course I know all sorts
 of things are wanted at Christmas.</p><br>
  <p>NORA. [Counting.] Ten, twenty, thirty, forty. Oh, thank you, thank
 you, Torvald! This will go a long way.</p><br>
    <p>   HELMER. I should hope so.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Yes, indeed; a long way! But come here, and let me show
 you all I've been buying. And so cheap! Look, here's a new suit
 for Ivar, and a little sword. Here are a horse and a trumpet for
 Bob. And here are a doll and a cradle for Emmy. They're only
 common; but they're good enough for her to pull to pieces. And
 dress-stuffs and kerchiefs for the servants. I ought to have got
 something better for old Anna</p><br>
                <p>HELMER. And what's in that other parcel?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Crying out.] No, Torvald, you're not to see that until this
 evening.</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. Oh! Ah! But now tell me, you little spendthrift, have you
 thought of anything for yourself?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. For myself! Oh, I don't want anything.</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. Nonsense! Just tell me something sensible you would like to
 have.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. No, really I don't know of anything- Well, listen, Torvald</p><br>
<p>HELMER. Well?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Playing with his coat-buttons, without looking him in the
 face.] If you really want to give me something, you might, you
 know- you might</p><br>
<p>HELMER. Well? Out with it!</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Quickly.] You might give me money, Torvald. Only just what
 you think you can spare; then I can buy something with it later on. </p><br>
