<p>NORA. Is it really so long since we met? Yes, so it is. Oh, the
 last eight years have been a happy time, I can tell you. And now
 you have come to town? All that long journey in mid-winter! How
 brave of you!</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. I arrived by this morning's steamer.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. To have a merry Christmas, of course. Oh, how delightful!
 Yes, we will have a merry Christmas. Do take your things off.
 Aren't you frozen? [Helping her.] There; now we'll sit cosily by
 the fire. No, you take the arm-chair; I shall sit in this
 rocking-chair. [Seizes her hands.] Yes, now I can see the dear
 old face again. It was only at the first glance- But you're a
 little paler, Christina- and perhaps a little thinner.</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. And much, much older, Nora.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Yes, perhaps a little older- not much- ever so little.
 [She suddenly checks herself; seriously.] Oh, what a thoughtless
 wretch I am! Here I sit chattering on, and- Dear, dear Christina,
 can you forgive me!</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. What do you mean, Nora?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Softly.] Poor Christina! I forgot: you are a widow.</p><br>
  <p>   MRS. LINDEN. Yes; my husband died three years ago.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. I know, I know; I saw it in the papers. Oh, believe me,
 Christina, I did mean to write to you; but I kept putting it off,
 and something always came in the way.</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. I can quite understand that, Nora dear.</p><br>
<p> NORA. No, Christina; it was horrid of me. Oh, you poor darling! how
 much you must have gone through!- And he left you nothing?</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. Nothing.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. And no children?</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. None.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Nothing, nothing at all?</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. Not even a sorrow or a longing to dwell upon.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. [Looking at her incredulously.] My dear Christina, how is
 that possible?</p><br>
 <p>MRS. LINDEN. [Smiling sadly and stroking her hair.] Oh, it happens
     so sometimes, Nora. </p><br>
