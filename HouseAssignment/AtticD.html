<p>  HELMER. Why, Nora, how unreasonable and ungrateful you are! Have
 you not been happy here?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. No, never. I thought I was; but I never was.</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. Not- not happy!</p><br>
 <p>NORA. No; only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But
 our house has been nothing but a play-room. Here I have been your
 doll-wife, just as at home I used to be papa's doll-child. And
 the children, in their turn, have been my dolls. I thought it fun
 when you played with me, just as the children did when I played
 with them. That has been our marriage, Torvald.</p><br>
<p> HELMER. There is some truth in what you say, exaggerated and
 overstrained though it be. But henceforth it shall be different.
 Play-time is over; now comes the time for education.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Whose education? Mine, or the children's?</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. Both, my dear Nora.</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Oh, Torvald, you are not the man to teach me to be a fit wife
 for you.</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. And you can say that?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. And I- how have I prepared myself to educate the children?</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. Nora!</p><br>
 <p>NORA. Did you not say yourself, a few minutes ago, you dared not
 trust them to me?</p><br>
 <p>HELMER. In the excitement of the moment! Why should you dwell upon
 that?</p><br>
 <p>NORA. No- you were perfectly right. That problem is beyond me.
 There is another to be solved first- I must try to educate
 myself. You are not the man to help me in that. I must set about
     it alone. And that is why I am leaving you. </p><br>
