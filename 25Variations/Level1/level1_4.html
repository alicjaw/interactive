<p>one toss of the dice never not even when cast in eternal circumstances from the depths of a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shipwreck &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the abyss whitened becalmed furious under an inclination glides desperately with wing its own in advance refallen with a difficulty in setting up flight and covering the outpourings cutting utterly the leaps very interiorly resumes the shade buried in the deep by that alternative sail as to adapt to its wingspan its gaping depth as the hull of a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tilted to one or the other side the master outside old calculations where the maneuver with age forgotten arisen inferringlong ago he grasped the helm of that conflagration at his feet of the unanimous horizon there is preparing stirring and mixing in the fist that might clutch it as one menaces a destiny and the winds the unique Number which cannot be another spirit to hurl it in the tempest refolding the division and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proud hesitates a corpse by the arm set apart from the secret it keeps rather than to play like a hoary maniac the game in the name of waves one invades the chief flows like a submissive beard shipwreck that direct from man sans ship no matter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vain ancestrally to not open the hand clenched beyond the useless head legacy in the disappearance to someone ambiguous the last immemorial demon having from null regions induced the old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

lost &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between the planks born of a gambol the sea with the grandfather tempting or the grandfather against the sea an idle chance betrothal whose veil of illusion gushed their phobia like the phantom of a gesture will totter will fall madness will abolish as if an insinuation simple in silence rolled with irony or the mystery precipitated howled in some nearby whirlpool of hilarity or horror flutters around the gulf without strewing it nor fleeing and cradles the virgin index as if plume solitary distraught save that encounters or skims it a midnight cap and immobilizes in velvet crumpled by a guffaw somber&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rigid whiteness derisory in opposition to the sky too much for not marking exiguously whosoever bitter prince of the reef puts it on like the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
